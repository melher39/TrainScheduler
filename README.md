# TrainScheduler
Firebase Assignment 

The purpose of this web app is to test my understanding of Firebase and the use of moment.js (somewhat).

Simply fill out the form on the site and select submit. The information will be displayed on the "Current Train Schedule."

All the information you input will be saved in the database and can later be edited by me.

All fields are required, otherwise app will not run upon selecting "submit."
